              Our Team is actively working on Governance Framework to make VX
              ecosystem completely transparent, decentralized and
              community-driven Fund. The Governance to the VX Unit holders will
              allow them to Vote & Validate the deals in the pool and also on
              the major decisions that are related to the future development and
              management of the VX ecosystem.

              The governance will play a key role in facilitating from
              centralized VC Fund controlled by single corporation to a
              decentralized platform that is autonomous and governed by
              community through protocols. The governance model of VX would
              eventually be more democratic and decentralized with the owners of
              VX units having real say in the functioning and a scope to voice
              their opinions on the directions of Venture-X.
